Tracking method for tropopause polar vortices (https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/11/5173/2018/)  

Tropopause polar vortices (TPVs) are coherent (anti)cyclonic features based on the tropopause common in polar regions with typical radii of 100 to 1000 km, intensities of 1 to 50 K, and lifetimes of days to months. For tracking TPVs natively on structured or unstructured grids, TPVs are segmented from the gridded flow field into spatial objects as restricted regional watershed basins on the tropopause, described by geometric metrics, associated over time by overlap similarity into major and minor correspondences, and tracked along major correspondences.
